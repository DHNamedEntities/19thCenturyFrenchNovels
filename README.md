# 19thCenturyFrenchNovels

19th century French novels manually annotated on named entities (places and fictional characters). 

These texts were annotated in the context of the interships of Aicha Soudani and Yosra Meherzi, hosted and funded by Carthage University and LATTICE Laboratory (UMR 8094) and co-supervised by Asma Bouhafs (Carthage University), Francesca Frontini (Praxiling) and Carmen Brando (EHESS) in collaboration with Yoann Dupont (INRIA) and Frédérique Mélanie-Becquet (LATTICE).

At the moment, annotated texts are available in two formats, in the BRAT format (NER) and XML/TEI (for NEL). You can train a 19th Century French novels NER model for SEM from the BRAT annotated files given above by installing the standalong tool (see https://github.com/YoannDupont/SEM). You can also test REDEN Online (http://obvil-dev.paris-sorbonne.fr/reden/RedenOnline/site/input-tei.html) by providing as input the XML files (see above).

Both tools, SEM and REDEN, are now compatible as the main objective of our work was to produce a NLP pipeline to recognize named entities, places and fictional characters.
